Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

1.  What does "Enter your Atlas API key" mean?

    You must obtain an API key free from Atlas MetaBroadcast before you can use this grabber. Instructions are available here: http://metabroadcast.com/blog/getting-full-uk-listings-data-from-atlas-it-s-easy
				
				
2.  I'm getting the error "Status: 400 Bad Request"

    Typically this is because you haven't entered your API key during the --configure stage.
		Or if you requested a particular channel with the --channel option but the channel cannot be found.
